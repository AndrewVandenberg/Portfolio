# Neural Network Projects

## [Gem Stone Project](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/TensorFlow_Gem_Project.ipynb)
This is my first NN project I am uploaded to GitHub. 
* I utilized Google Collab, along with the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, skikitlearn, keras, and seaborn for this project.
* I used data from a Kaggle dataset to create a NN model.
* I created a Neaural Network that predicted the price of gemstones based on two features.
* The accuracy of this model had a MAE of $4, with the mean of the data being around $500.

## [Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/LeNet%20Traffic%20Sign%20Classification.ipynb)
I used a LeNet-CNN to help better classify traffic signals.
* This project made use of matplotlib, seaborn, keras, sklearn, pandas, and numpy
* I utilized the Pickle library to...
* This project classified images to help self-driving cars better navigate on the roads autonomously.

## [Car Sales Prediction](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/Car%20Sales.ipynb)
I utilized ANN's to predict the possible price range any given customer would be willing to consider based on features known about them.
* I used Jupyter Notebook for this project
* I utilized Tensorflow and Keras

# Regression Projects

## [Boston Housing Pricing](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/Boston%20Housing%20.ipynb)
I utilized linear regression to help predict the prices of houses in the boston area.
* I performed an EDA to discover what features were the most influential in predicting house prices.
* My MAE was 3.84, MSE 28.55, and RMSE 5.34

# Classification Projects

## [Titanic Project](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Titanic)
I utilized logistic regression as a way to determine whether a passenger survived or not based on their various features.

* I utilized Jupyter Notebook, along with the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, skikit learn, and seaborn for this project.
* I used the Kaggle data set Titanic to create a ML model.
* I used the logistic regression model to predict the survival of each passenger.
* The precision of this model came out to be around 78%.

## [Iris Project](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/Iris%20Project.ipynb)
This was a classification problem, which required me to classify different flowers into either one of three different species.
* I used K-Nearest Neighbor to solve this problem

## [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer.ipynb)
For this classification problem, I used Support Vector Machines to classify whether someone has breast cancer based on different features/variables.
* With this dataset, I was able to accurately predict whether someone has breast cancer 91% of the time!

## [Email Spam Filter](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/Email%20Spam%20Filter.ipynb)
This project used a Naive Bayes classifier to differentiate between spam and "ham" emails.
* With this model, I was able to achieve a 98% accuracy rate.

## [Movie Recommendation Model]()
This model predicts potential movie interests to a viewer based on their reviews of previous movies.
* This model did not rely on the sklearn librbary or NN's; 
* Instead utilizing the pandas library a great deal.
* There is no ability to check the accuracy of this model.

# Forecasting Projects

## [Crime Rate in Chicago](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/Crime%20Rate%20in%20Chicago.ipynb)
This was my introduction to FaceBook's Prophet library. With this data set, I was able to produce predictions about future crime within the city of Chicago based on past, available, data.

* FB Prophet is used to forecast time-series data based on an additive model.
* I utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to better understand the data visually.
* I was able to use the data to study the general trends within the data.
