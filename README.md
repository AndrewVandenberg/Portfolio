# [Project 1](XXXXXXX)
This is my first project that I am putting on GitHub.

## 1) Acquiring and Organizing data
In this step, I used the Pandas library to aquire, organize, and format the data in a way that I could use.

## 2) Exploratory data analysis
With the data formatted, I was free to skim over it to see if there was anything interesting, or immediately obvious, to further explore.

## 3) Separated the data through sklearn, such that it could be used by Linear Regression
I separated the columns into the dependent/target variable y, and the independent variables X, so that I could utilize linear regression to make meaningful predictions about the data.
