# Regression Projects

## [Boston Housing Pricing]()
I utilized linear regression to help predict the prices of houses in the boston area.
* I performed an EDA to discover what features were the most influential in predicting house prices.
* My MAE was 3.84, MSE 28.55, and RMSE 5.34

# Classification Projects

## [Titanic Project](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Titanic)
I utilized logistic regression as a way to determine whether a passenger survived or not based on their various features.

* I utilized Jupyter Notebook, along with the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, skikit learn, and seaborn for this project.
* I used the Kaggle data set Titanic to create a ML model.
* I used the logistic regression model to predict the survival of each passenger.
* The precision of this model came out to be around 78%.

## [Iris Project](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/Iris%20Project.ipynb)
This was a classification problem, which required me to classify different flowers into either one of three different species.
* I used K-Nearest Neighbor to solve this problem


# Neural Network Projects

## [Gem Stone Project](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/TensorFlow_Gem_Project.ipynb)
This is my first NN project I am uploaded to GitHub. More information on the project link.
* I utilized Google Collab, along with the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, skikitlearn, keras, and seaborn for this project.
* I used data from a Kaggle dataset to create a NN model.
* I created a Neaural Network that predicted the price of gemstones based on two features.
* The accuracy of this model had a MAE of $4, with the mean of the data being around $500.
