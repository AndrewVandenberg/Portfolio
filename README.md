# [Titanic Project](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Titanic)
This is my first project that I am putting on GitHub. More information on the project link.
* I utilized Jupyter Notebook, along with the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, skikit learn, and seaborn for this project.
* I used the Kaggle data set Titanic to create a ML model.
* I used a logistic regression model to predict the survival of each passenger.
* The precision of this model came out to be around 72%.

unsupervised learning projects. nlp, genetics and diseases, social sciences, etc.

# [Gem Stone Project](https://github.com/AndrewVandenberg/Portfolio/blob/main/TensorFlow_Gem_Project.ipynb)
This is my first NN project I am uploaded to GitHub. More information on the project link.
* I utilized Google Collab, along with the libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, skikitlearn, keras, and seaborn for this project.
* I used data from a Kaggle dataset to create a NN model.
* I created a Neaural Network that predicted the price of gemstones based on two features.
* The accuracy of this model had a MAE of $4, with the mean of the data being around $500.
